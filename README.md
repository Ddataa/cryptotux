# Cryptotux

Cryptotux is a Linux image preconfigured with tools for cryptoassets, blockchains and Distributed Ledger Technologies. It has been conceived to be an educational tool and a development environment.

Cryptotux is currently supplied as .ova images that can be directly imported into Virtualbox (6.X+) and VMWare. This allows to jump-start workshops directly to code or to test new nodes in an isolated manner. It can also be directly installed on a server or on Windows Subsystem for Linux.
