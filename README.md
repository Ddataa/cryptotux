# Cryptotux

Cryptotux is a Linux image preconfigured with tools for crypto development and education.

Cryptotux is currently supplied as .ova images that can be directly imported into Virtualbox (6.X+) and VMWare. 
It is particularly suited for workshops. Username is *bobby*, password is *bricodeur*.

## How to use it? 

Cryptotux can be installed on VirtualBox, on Windows Subsystem for Linux or on a server

### Easy visual way with VirtualBox
* Install [virtualbox](https://virtualbox.org) (and activate VT-x/AMD-V in the BIOS if needed)
* Download the latest "Desktop image" on [cryptotux.org](https://cryptotux.org)
* Click on the file or in "‚Ü∂ import appliance" in virtualbox
* Press "Start ‚û°Ô∏è" on virtualbox 

Keyboard layout, and screen resolution, can be changed by clicking on the icons at the bottom. Left click the flag to go through default options: US, FR, ES, US Mac. Right click and then "keyboard layout handler" to add more options.

### Server launch and connection
The server version allows you to launch nodes and tools in a contained environment while developping from your regular desktop. Follow the instructions above for the desktop choosing the "Server image" instead. You can then connect with two methods:
* Connect via ssh `ssh bobby@192.168.33.10`
* Open a browser at http://192.168.33.10:3310/ 

For further options, see [ssh configuration](doc/ssh-configuration.md)

### Installation in Windows Subsystem for Linux
1. Install and activate [WSL **2**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
2. In the Microsoft Store, install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
4. Launch Ubuntu from the menu and type in
```bash
bash -x <(curl -sL https://cryptotux.org/install)
```
It is advisable to extend the `sudo` password delay first. You might also need to press enter occasionally.

For further details, see [install on WSL](doc/install-on-Windows-WSL.md)

### Installation on top of an existing configuration
You can install Cryptotux on an existing Ubuntu local install or on a server.
```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://cryptotux.org/install)
```
It has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04. It should work on most Ubuntu based distribution and it can work on Debian 10 with minor changes (docker repository and adding current user to /etc/sudoers). Don't do this on a production machine.


## Contribution
We aim to provide a useful tool and meaningful project as a collaborative effort. The first objective is to offer a standard distribution for education and development. Suggestions, remarks, partnerships and pull requests are welcome.

* [To fork](https://github.com/cryptotuxorg/cryptotux/fork)

There are two sets of installation scripts:

* install*.sh are bash installation scripts. They can be applied to a local install, a server, WSL or a vagrant box
   - install-base.sh configures a Vagrant box or a server to add a regular user
   - **install-server.sh** is the key script installing basic development tools, common configuration and a Bitcoin node
   - install/ contains scripts that will be applicable once launched, including the desktop
* flavours/ contains Ansible playbooks (in provisioning/) and several flavours of cryptotux

Provided ova images are built from the vagrantfile using bash scripts.

### To build images from scratch

* Install [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and virtualbox. 
* To build and run the server version `vagrant up`
* To connect to the server : `vagrant ssh`

And voil√† !

To build and run the desktop version `vagrant up desktop` or run the command `cryptotux desktop` within the default virtual machine. This desktop build is meant for educational purposes.

For the ansible version, move to the desired flavour and type `vagrant up`. See [readme](flavours/README.md)
